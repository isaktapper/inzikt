# Authentication and Profile Fixes

This guide outlines steps to fix the authentication and profile-related issues in the application.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Zod Validation Error**: Fixed the validation schema to better handle undefined/nullable fields in profiles
2. **Profile Data Access**: Enhanced the getUserProfile helper to be more resilient 
3. **Hydration Error**: Fixed client/server mismatch by properly handling loading states
4. **Data Isolation**: Fixed RLS policies to ensure users can only see their own data

## Installation Steps

1. Apply the code changes to the following files:
   - `lib/getUserProfile.ts` - Fixed Zod validation and made profile fetching more robust
   - `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` - Fixed hydration issues and proper user data isolation
   - `app/components/TagSetupModal.tsx` - Enhanced error handling

2. Apply the RLS policy fixes to your Supabase database:

```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
npm install dotenv

# Run the RLS fix script
node scripts/apply-rls-fix.js
```

## Manual Testing

After applying the fixes, test the following:

1. Login with different user accounts and verify they can only see their own data
2. Navigate to pages that require profile data and ensure they load correctly
3. Check that tag setup works properly with no validation errors

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow

The improved auth flow ensures:

1. The current user is properly fetched from Supabase Auth
2. Profile data is properly validated and standardized
3. RLS policies enforce data isolation 

### Error Handling

We've added better error recovery:

1. Profile validation provides fallbacks when possible
2. UI shows helpful error messages
3. Profile fetch errors redirect to login

### Data Isolation

To ensure users can only access their own data:

1. All profile queries include `auth.uid() = id` row-level security
2. Ticket queries include `user_id` filters
3. The tickets table has proper RLS policies that ensure users can only see their own tickets

## Troubleshooting

If you're still having issues:

1. Clear your browser cache and cookies
2. Check the Supabase logs for RLS policy errors
3. Verify that your database schema matches the expected profile structure
